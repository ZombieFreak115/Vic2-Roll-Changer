# Vic2-Roll-Changer
A script for patching the Victoria 2 exe to change combat rolls.

Usage:

Make sure you have Python installed, preferably 3.8 or newer. When installing, do a custom install and check the Install to PATH, Add to system variables, and Install PY launcher checkmarks.

After download, extract and put the "Vic2_Roll_Changer.py" in the directory together with your "v2game.exe" (your main V2 directory most likely). Run the program and follow the instructions, afterwards a new patched exe will be created, which you can then rename to "v2game.exe" to use. (Recommended to backup the vanilla exe incase you want to rollback easily)

Compatabillity:

The patched exe *should* be compatible with every mod (only tested a few) as rolls are hardcoded and do not interact with anything scriptable in a mod as far as i know. To run mods with the patched exe, simply use the launcher and select the mod with the patched exe being called "v2game.exe" in the game dir.
Multiplayer should also be fully compatible as the checksum changes if the exe is patched.
